### Day 15: October 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** finished reviewing Voluntr PRs, and started researching web scraping as an idea to quickly populate our db with test data.  

**Thoughts:** Using python and Beautiful Soup 4 is a lot simpler than I expected, and I can see how writing scripts like this could make some daily tasks significantly easier!  Looking forward to applying this is other contexts also.
