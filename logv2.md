# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: September 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Volunteered at WordCampPDX!

**Thoughts:** Didn't do any coding, but I watched and learned a lot!  Also, I'm starting a second log because somehow I lost 30-something days from the last one. There are 100 days between now and Jan 1.

### Day 02: September 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Set up exercism.io on my machine and did the first JS exercise.  

**Thoughts:** I'm getting better at setting up my environment and following/troubleshooting technical instructions.  This process was WAY less painful than it has been in the past.  Progress, right?  Still working on setting up ESLint to use as my linter.

### Day 03: September 25, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Contacted a recruiter, completed another exercism challenge and went to LC101 for the first class of the new session!  

**Thoughts:** No coding in class yet, but we will be starting group projects soon.  Looking forward to building something more substantial in python!

### Day 04: September 26, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Completed a hackerrank algorithm with Joe and Reuben, talked with a ReBoot counselor, did some Khan Academy and made JS study plans with other LC101 grads.
