**Today's Progress:** Set up exercism.io on my machine and did the first JS exercise.

**Today's Progress:** Volunteered at WordCampPDX!

**Thoughts:** Didn't do any coding, but I watched and learned a lot!  Also, I'm starting a second log because somehow I lost 30-something days from the last one. There are 100 days between now and Jan 1.
