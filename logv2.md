# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 35: October 27, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Pair programmed with Alison today and got the manifest file written up for Portals!  I also added a basic HTML file for us to get started with.  We talked a lot about which options will be best for our needs, and now it's time to start building.   

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to have such a great partner for this project!

### Day 34: October 26, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I worked on 2 issues for Voluntr today, and went to class where we talked about whiteboarding for interviews.  

**Thoughts:** Right now I am focusing on the org side of the application.  It's been interesting to put myself in the customer's shoes and think about which options and features would be best for them.  It's also been surprising at how much their needs differ from volunteers.

### Day 33: October 25, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Spent most of today thinking about and working on research for Portals.  Had a great meeting with Alison and decided which tasks we should try to accomplish by our pair programming meeting on Friday.  

**Thoughts:** Chrome has really great documentation and we are learning a lot!  I hope that it is as easy to implement as it seems.

### Day 32: October 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Worked with Reuben and Joe on next steps for Web Bakers.  We closed completed issues, clarified existing ones, and added new tasks to the issue tracker. I made a small PR to add new packages to the requirements file in Voluntr. 

**Thoughts:** I need to get some progress made on Portals, but ran out of time today.

### Day 31: October 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a bug in the Web Bakers app to implement the date formatting function written by Reuben last week.  We created a central file to hold all of our helper functions used in the views. Tonight we had our first sprint retro review and demoed Voluntr to the rest of the class. At the end of class I pair programmed with a partner to refactor some duplicate code in different parts of our application.   

**Thoughts:** Even though I felt really down and sick for most of today, I'm proud of what I got accomplished!

### Day 30: October 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today was mostly a day off, but I did end up adding the version tag to the relevant commit so that our TF could checkout our Voluntr code.  I learned something new and interesting about git!  We got some positive feedback from Wolfgang and also some ideas on things that need to be added to the app.   

**Thoughts:** Today I was a little afraid of adding anything new to the repo, because I knew we would have to send it in as our demo soon.  I did get some new issues created, and tried to be available to my team and to the teaching fellow that is going to look at our code.

### Day 29: October 21, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked with my Voluntr team, resolving small bugs and answering questions about my PR. I made a tiny bug fix and mostly reviewed other PRs.

**Thoughts:** I thought of some new enhancements today that I will try to turn into issues either today or tomorrow to give me something to work on in my next sprint.

### Day 28: October 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on making a nicer looking wireframe with Pencil for Portals - to be added to our README.  We talked a little more about git workflows and ways to use our toolsets.  I wrote an agenda for our Portals meeting this weekend.  Then I worked on Voluntr for the rest of the day. I stayed up very late in a flow state, and got my giant PR for the organizations to add opportunities posted around 2 AM.  

**Thoughts:** I woke up with a terrible cold, so most of today was spent on activities that required very little thinking or energy.  I'm really proud of what I was able to accomplish today, despite being sick.

### Day 27: October 19, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I drew up some wireframes for Portals, then had a long chat with @catsoundsawesome where we tried to really get organized and decide which tools we would be using.  We also talked about the features that we wanted to include in the MVP, as well as settling on a design for the project! It was really good progress.  I did a tiny bit more work on the organization post route for Voluntr, but got caught in some errors, so put it aside to complete my homework for LC101. I wrote a binary search 2 ways: 1 with recursion and 1 with a while loop.  I also reviewed a few PRs that came up during the day and in class for Voluntr.  

**Thoughts:** I didn't push my binary searches to github, but I will by the time this log is sent over.  I'm feeling really good about Voluntr, and getting more and more excited to work on Portals!

### Day 26: October 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I made a few last minute changes to my organization-side PR for Voluntr based on feedback and help from my team.  Special thanks to @RylandBell for the help with formatting!  I also started brainstorming a new project: a chrome extension that allows a user to customize their most-frequently used websites when they open a new tab in Chrome.  Today I created the repo and wrote up a README for the project, heavily based on Voluntr's Readme formatting. We are tentatively calling it Portals to another web, or Portals for short.  

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get started on another group project with my friend @catsoundsawesome from Chingu!  This chrome extension idea has been rattling around in my head forever, so it will be fun to see how much and how fast I can pick up this new concept in tech. I am also planning to document our progress on this project via Medium articles. which is a new and scary step, but I think it will really help me stay on track with making sure I am progressing week by week.

### Day 25: October 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** This morning I worked with FCW friends and submitted my final PR about the drop_create route - I think Joe and Reuben are getting close to meeting their Hacktoberfest PR goals too! I created 2 issues for Voluntr on the organization side, and completed one of them - PR is pending.  Now when organizations are signed in, they can see all open volunteer opportunities on their homepage.  

**Thoughts:** Today I learned that code can be executed from inside jinja2 placeholders, and a little more about datetime formatting.

### Day 24: October 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Had a few issues with getting the /drop_create route set up, but got an incomplete PR submitted.  Also went to class, learned about algorithms, and had a practice stand-up with the team.    

**Thoughts:** Connecting the csv data with the db was easy once I figured out how to reference files that were several steps/levels away. The datetime object stored with each opportunity was still problematic, but I wanted the sample data to be available to everyone, so I opened a PR to get things started.  

**Link to work:** [PR](https://github.com/hendricksonsarahl/voluntr/pull/65)

### Day 23: October 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I completed the CSV import into Voluntr, and did some more reading about how to read files in python.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning a lot of new small skills that haven't come up before in my coding.  Pretty exciting!

**Link to Work:** [PR](https://github.com/hendricksonsarahl/voluntr/pull/62)

### Day 22: October 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** 30 min. of Khan Academy practice, gave feedback to FCW/Chingu friend Joe about his potential Medium post, and wrote up our testing plan for the Voluntr README.  Also started work on CSV data import into Voluntr.  

**Thoughts:** I feel really happy with what I accomplished today considering all the other life obligations on my plate.

### Day 21: October 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I was pretty sick today, but did get a little brainstorming accomplished for Voluntr, did 30 minutes of pair programming/technical screening for admission to Hackbright Academy, and received word that I was accepted into their January cohort!

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about the prospect of attending such an amazing code school!

### Day 20: October 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on exercism exercises in python, looked into pytestBDD for implementation in Voluntr, and did 30 minutes of Khan Academy practice before class.  During LC101 we updated our issues in Github and talked about next steps.  

**Thoughts:** I was starting to feel a little overwhelmed by all the pieces we have in motion for Voluntr, but after some discussion with my team, it's not so bad.  Teamwork and communication is key! 

### Day 19: October 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I finished the NCRC exam via Worksource, did some more testing research, and got a test branch started for Voluntr.  Also pulled down some python exercises from exercism, and it's been good practice, both for Friday's pair programming session, and to see how the unittest library works in python!

**Thoughts:** Still feeling a bit stressed, but looking forward to tomorrow night's class and finally getting this interview process completed!

### Day 18: October 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on linked list algos with FCWs using the LeetCode platform this morning.  Dug into the pytest docs, and filled out some sample test data for Voluntr to work with as we start putting the app together!

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel anxious about my technical screening on Friday, so I'm throwing myself into other assignments in the meantime :)

### Day 17: October 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Spoke with a bootcamp rep and arranged for technical interview practice on Friday.  Reviewed more Voluntr PRs, and met the team before class to continue brainstorming and talk about next steps.  Class covered testing, met with our TF for an update, and added issues to work on this week.  

**Thoughts:** I'm excited that Voluntr progress seems to be on schedule (maybe even slightly ahead of schedule) so far.  

### Day 16: October 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on web scraping volunteermatch.org - no success, but had fun trying to parse their API calls!  

**Thoughts:** Today was a less 

### Day 15: October 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** finished reviewing Voluntr PRs, and started researching web scraping as an idea to quickly populate our db with test data.  

**Thoughts:** Using python and Beautiful Soup 4 is a lot simpler than I expected, and I can see how writing scripts like this could make some daily tasks significantly easier!  Looking forward to applying this is other contexts also.
