### Day 1: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I want to go through the basic front-end projects on freeCodeCamp again, so today I cloned the example tribute page project. I'll be saving most small projects for 100 days of code in this same repo.

**Thoughts:** It is good to practice with the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap I have been ignoring while studying JS. It looks like I could have used a lot more bootstrap and a lot less CSS when I compare my code to the original, so I will need to study more of that in the future.  Overall, I'm please with how this came out.
