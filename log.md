# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I want to go through the basic front-end projects on freeCodeCamp again, so today I cloned the example tribute page project. I'll be saving most small projects for 100 days of code in this same repo.

**Thoughts:** It is good to practice with the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap I have been ignoring while studying JS. It looks like I could have used a lot more bootstrap and a lot less CSS when I compare my code to the original, so I will need to study more of that in the future.  Overall, I'm please with how this came out.

### Day 2: May 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I started rewriting my original tribute page design using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts:** I am pleased with the progress I made in an hour today, but hope to finish this project in the next few days.  I am finding that writing the page content is the most time consuming part, and the bootstrap documentation is getting much easier to read.

### Day 3: May 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I participated in Write the Docs conference, and  successfully wrote a vigenere cipher algorithm in python.

**Thoughts:** The conference writing day was a valuable experience, as I got to hear about a lot of documentation projects and workflows. I was even able to assist with some changes to the reference pages for Mozilla Developer Network. I can't post my vigenere code until after my class is over, but I'm also ecstatic to have this working!

### Day 4: May 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress:**Today I attended Write the Docs conference and completed an algorithm challenge in Javascript.

**Thoughts:**More thoughts coming tomorrow, I'm pretty exhausted for now. Learned a LOT today!

### Day 5: May 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Attended day 2 of Write the Docs North America, and solved the same CodeWars algorithm in Javascript and Python

**Thoughts:**My inner introvert is exhausted by a large group like a conference, but the people attending Write the Docs have been wonderful and welcoming.  If I ever find myself doing extenssive documentation or technical writing, I will definitely be back. I'm learning a lot about resources and the importance of content and structure in documentation. As far as algorithm practice goes, today was fine, but I'm looking forward to getting into practice projects again tomorrow.
