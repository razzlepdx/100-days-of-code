# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I want to go through the basic front-end projects on freeCodeCamp again, so today I cloned the example tribute page project. I'll be saving most small projects for 100 days of code in this same repo.

**Thoughts:** It is good to practice with the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap I have been ignoring while studying JS. It looks like I could have used a lot more bootstrap and a lot less CSS when I compare my code to the original, so I will need to study more of that in the future.  Overall, I'm please with how this came out.

### Day 2: May 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I started rewriting my original tribute page design using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts:** I am pleased with the progress I made in an hour today, but hope to finish this project in the next few days.  I am finding that writing the page content is the most time consuming part, and the bootstrap documentation is getting much easier to read.

### Day 3: May 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I participated in Write the Docs conference, and  successfully wrote a vigenere cipher algorithm in python.

**Thoughts:** The conference writing day was a valuable experience, as I got to hear about a lot of documentation projects and workflows. I was even able to assist with some changes to the reference pages for Mozilla Developer Network. I can't post my vigenere code until after my class is over, but I'm also ecstatic to have this working!

### Day 4: May 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress:**Today I attended Write the Docs conference and completed an algorithm challenge in Javascript.

**Thoughts:**More thoughts coming tomorrow, I'm pretty exhausted for now. Learned a LOT today!

### Day 5: May 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Attended day 2 of Write the Docs North America, and solved a CodeWars algorithm in Javascript and Python

**Thoughts:**My inner introvert is exhausted by a large group like a conference, but the people attending Write the Docs have been wonderful and welcoming.  If I ever find myself doing extenssive documentation or technical writing, I will definitely be back. I'm learning a lot about resources and the importance of content and structure in documentation. As far as algorithm practice goes, today was fine, but I'm looking forward to getting into practice projects again tomorrow.

### Day 6: May 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent a couple of hours working on this FCC intermediate algorithm called Roman Numeral Converter. I pair programmed with some cohort friends for about an hour, then worked on my own.  I also attended an excellent git/Github workshop sponsored by Women Who Code. 

**Thoughts:** Daily coding practice has really increased my confidence and comfort level re: git and version control.  My algorithm practice was frustrating due to the difficulty of the problem today, but I'm pretty happy to have solved it at last.

### Day 7: May 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I got back to math practice with Khan Academy and worked on python lessons for class.  The in-class studio projects were both about classes. 

**Thoughts:** I think I could enjoy object-oriented programming - there are some things about that structure type that really make sense to me.  I will be looking for more ways to practice soon.

### Day 8: May 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress:**Today I did a little bit of work and spent some time on a codewars algorithm, completed day 8 of JavaScript30, and did 30 minutes of math practice on Khan Academy. 

**Thoughts:**Took a weekend to rest, and feel much better now.  I'll be ready to jump back into things on Monday!

### Day 9: May 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Prepped for class, read a chapter of YDKJS and worked on/helped with final assignments for unit 1 of LC101 today.

**Thoughts:** I was less productive than usual for a Monday, thanks to this heat wave!  Tomorrow I will be looking for a cooler study spot.  I will be a little sad to finish the python unit in LC101, it has been really enjoyable.  I can't upload any of my work from today until the assignment deadline has passed.

### Day 10: May 23, 2017 
**Today's Progress:** Today I started reviewing the first few days of JS30, did 30 minutes of math practice with Khan Academy, and made a little progress on my Web Developer Bootcamp course. 

**Thoughts:** I found it hard to focus again today, going to try to sleep more and see if that helps my productivity tomorrow.

### Day 11: May 24, 2017 
**Today's Progress:** refactored my final python assignment for LC101 today, based on feedback from my teaching fellow, and attended a study group to help others finish up their crypto assignment

**Thoughts:** It was good to get some feedback on this assignment, and I'm excited to post the updated code to my LC101 repo once the due date has passed (June 1).

### Day 12: May 25, 2017 
**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on updating my habitica test environment, and familiarizing myself with some of the files so that I can work on the issue my group has been assigned.  Tonight is the last class for unit 1 of LC101! 

**Thoughts:** It is a little overwhelming looking at the code for such a large application, but I'm feeling much better now that my test environment is ready to go.  I have some ideas of what I need to do to fix this problem, so once I find the appropriate files, it shouldn't be too hard to get started!  So far this week has been a failure at practicing HTML/CSS, so I will try to push even harder to work on that this weekend.

### Day 13: May 26, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I reviewed day 6 and completed day 9 of JS30, practiced math for 30 minutes, and completed a big chunk of Colt Steele's Complete Web Developer Bootcamp course. 

**Thoughts:** So far in the WDB class the JS integrations into HTML documents have been pretty minimal and (dare I say it?) kind of lame.  I'm looking forward to getting to a point when I can get user input without utilizing prompt() and communicate changes without relying on alert() and console.log().  JS30 progress is going well, but I do wish I knew more about ES6 before starting these projects.  I'm thinking about going through another Udemy class on ES6/7 when I finish WDB.

### Day 14: May 27, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Late update! Yesterday I completed day 10 of JS30, and a big chunk of WDB related to JS (finished at video 130). 

**Thoughts:** WDB has been mostly review for me, but I do like getting into the habit of creating a html file and then attaching my .js file for easier debugging/testing in the console. The JS30 task for day 10, adding a shift click option to select multiple checkboxes, seems like it could be used in a lot of different ways, so I'm going to bookmark that one for future projects.

### Day 15: May 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress:**Today I helped a fellow LaunchCoder by answering questions about the final assignment, met with  @jjprevite to work on our Habitica pull request, and spent the rest of the day working through WDB.

**Thoughts:** It's really exciting to see some progress on the Habitica project! I was a little nervous that my current skills/knowledge weren't up to the task, but Joe and I did it! Feeling accomplished and like I know how to approach things next time.  I'm really starting to enjoy the WDB course as well - spending more focused time on it this week will be a good thing.

### Day 16: May 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I met with my FCW group for our weekly updates, then pair programmed on our group Habitica issue with Joe from Chingu/FCW.  

**Thoughts:** I wish I had accomplished a little more today, but I feel good about our progress on the Habitica issue!  It was my first time working with a .jade file, so learning how to read it and what we needed to do to make the necessary changes was a great experience. By the end of our session we were able to fix one of the issue requirements (markdown was not rendered in a specific area).

### Day 17: May 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I completed all the prep work for the first session of LaunchCode's Unit 2, via Udacity and CodeAcademy.  I also spent about 3 hours on Habitica - deleting and reinstalling my local environment, as well as continuing to work on the group approvals screen.  I may have had a small breakthrough with that, but we will need to see if Habitica likes my changes or not.  

**Thoughts:**  I am getting ready to start a speedrun for building freeCodeCamp projects, so I think this refresher on the front end from LaunchCode will be very timely!  The Habitica problem I was working on had to do with text and button alignment, so it was a great chance for me to practice using the developer tools and adjust the HTML/CSS that way before spending my time writing code and updating the database.  I am hoping to be finished with JS30 soon, at which time I will get started on the dailycssimages challenge.

### Day 18: June 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Completed lessons 11,13 and 14 of JS30.

**Thoughts:** I am really enjoying completing these projects - it is really helpful to see how a professional organizes and thinks about their code - even though I am not always understanding every step, it's a nice series to follow for the exposure to well-written ES6 alone.

### Day 19: June 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I completed day 16 of JS30, and did about 2 hours of Web Developer Bootcamp. 

**Thoughts:** I was able to study at the library for the first time in a while, and it was so nice and really helped me stay focused! I will be coming in more often in the future.

### Day 20: June 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I did a little bit of work yesterday, but not a full hour of code :(. Today I worked mainly on WDB.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning so much from this class! Right now I'm working through the color game project and I am really getting a good handle on event listeners now. Will post a link to my colorgame project when it is finished.

### Day 21: June 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Continued progress on the colorgame and went to LC101.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 22: June 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I met with Reuben from FCW to talk about future projects, began lead-planning for the chingu cohorts, and continued work on the colorgame (not too much due to having a migraine).

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to welcome/kick off a new group of Chingus this Friday! The next 5 weeks should be really busy and fun.  FCW stuff is great too - our first pull request was accepted by Habitica and our Speedrun challenge begins this week.  I really should be working on my portfolio site right now :/

### Day 23: June 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress:**  Today I went through a bunch of HTML and CSS exercises on Codecademy for LC101. git

### Day 24: June 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Finished the colorgame project!  Also went to class, practiced with git, and met with Joe and Nedu to plan our first week in the armadillos cohort.

**Thoughts:** Feeling accomplished today!

### Day 25: June 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today was the kickoff day for Armadillos cohort! I spent a lot of time in slack welcoming new members and connecting them with other students/links that might be helpful. Progressed in WDB (refactored colorgame and finished JQuery unit) and worked on LC101 homework - setup and worked inside a virtual environment, and used Flask for the first time!

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of fun today! Hoping to finish up my portfolio this weekend.

### Day 26: June 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Continued progress in WDB, and started work on personal portfolio project!

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day!

### Day 27: June 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Did just a little more work on the portfolio today, and also some reading for LC101. 

**Thoughts:** The portfolio is not going as smoothly as I'd hoped.  Will need to work on it some more tomorrow.

### Day 28: June 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Finished prep work for class, set up some polls in the cohorts using /polly on Slack, and started a Flask app in the studio tonight.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't feeling great today, so I had to sleep for a little bit instead of finishing up my portfolio.  Will have a first draft completed by tomorrow, I hope. I am excited about the Flask app we are starting to build in LC101, however!
