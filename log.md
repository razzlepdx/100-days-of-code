# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I want to go through the basic front-end projects on freeCodeCamp again, so today I cloned the example tribute page project. I'll be saving most small projects for 100 days of code in this same repo.

**Thoughts:** It is good to practice with the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap I have been ignoring while studying JS. It looks like I could have used a lot more bootstrap and a lot less CSS when I compare my code to the original, so I will need to study more of that in the future.  Overall, I'm please with how this came out.

### Day 2: May 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I started rewriting my original tribute page design using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts:** I am pleased with the progress I made in an hour today, but hope to finish this project in the next few days.  I am finding that writing the page content is the most time consuming part, and the bootstrap documentation is getting much easier to read.

### Day 3: May 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I participated in Write the Docs conference, and  successfully wrote a vigenere cipher algorithm in python.

**Thoughts:** The conference writing day was a valuable experience, as I got to hear about a lot of documentation projects and workflows. I was even able to assist with some changes to the reference pages for Mozilla Developer Network. I can't post my vigenere code until after my class is over, but I'm also ecstatic to have this working!

### Day 4: May 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress:**Today I attended Write the Docs conference and completed an algorithm challenge in Javascript.

**Thoughts:**More thoughts coming tomorrow, I'm pretty exhausted for now. Learned a LOT today!

### Day 5: May 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Attended day 2 of Write the Docs North America, and solved a CodeWars algorithm in Javascript and Python

**Thoughts:**My inner introvert is exhausted by a large group like a conference, but the people attending Write the Docs have been wonderful and welcoming.  If I ever find myself doing extenssive documentation or technical writing, I will definitely be back. I'm learning a lot about resources and the importance of content and structure in documentation. As far as algorithm practice goes, today was fine, but I'm looking forward to getting into practice projects again tomorrow.

### Day 6: May 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent a couple of hours working on this FCC intermediate algorithm called Roman Numeral Converter. I pair programmed with some cohort friends for about an hour, then worked on my own.  I also attended an excellent git/Github workshop sponsored by Women Who Code. 

**Thoughts:** Daily coding practice has really increased my confidence and comfort level re: git and version control.  My algorithm practice was frustrating due to the difficulty of the problem today, but I'm pretty happy to have solved it at last.

### Day 7: May 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Today I got back to math practice with Khan Academy and worked on python lessons for class.  The in-class studio projects were both about classes. 

**Thoughts:** I think I could enjoy object-oriented programming - there are some things about that structure type that really make sense to me.  I will be looking for more ways to practice soon.

### Day 8: May 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress:**Today I did a little bit of work and spent some time on a codewars algorithm, completed day 8 of JavaScript30, and did 30 minutes of math practice on Khan Academy. 

**Thoughts:**Took a weekend to rest, and feel much better now.  I'll be ready to jump back into things on Monday!

### Day 9: May 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Prepped for class, read a chapter of YDKJS and worked on/helped with final assignments for unit 1 of LC101 today.

**Thoughts:** I was less productive than usual for a Monday, thanks to this heat wave!  Tomorrow I will be looking for a cooler study spot.  I will be a little sad to finish the python unit in LC101, it has been really enjoyable.  I can't upload any of my work from today until the assignment deadline has passed.

### Day 10: May 23, 2017 
**Today's Progress:** Today I started reviewing the first few days of JS30, did 30 minutes of math practice with Khan Academy, and made a little progress on my Web Developer Bootcamp course. 

**Thoughts:** I found it hard to focus again today, going to try to sleep more and see if that helps my productivity tomorrow.

### Day 11: May 24, 2017 
**Today's Progress:** refactored my final python assignment for LC101 today, based on feedback from my teaching fellow, and attended a study group to help others finish up their crypto assignment

**Thoughts:** It was good to get some feedback on this assignment, and I'm excited to post the updated code to my LC101 repo once the due date has passed (June 1).

### Day 12: May 25, 2017 
**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on updating my habitica test environment, and familiarizing myself with some of the files so that I can work on the issue my group has been assigned.  Tonight is the last class for unit 1 of LC101! 

**Thoughts:** It is a little overwhelming looking at the code for such a large application, but I'm feeling much better now that my test environment is ready to go.  I have some ideas of what I need to do to fix this problem, so once I find the appropriate files, it shouldn't be too hard to get started!  So far this week has been a failure at practicing HTML/CSS, so I will try to push even harder to work on that this weekend.
