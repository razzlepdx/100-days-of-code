### Colorgame Project

**Details:

	- Completed this game as part of the [Web Developer Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
	- Some refactoring still needed
	- Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	- Project Description: 
		A user can play a color guessing game on this website.  The header displays an RGB value, and there are squares of random colors below, one of which is a match for that RGB value.  The user can toggle between two game modes, easy (3 color options) and hard (6 color options).  There is also a button to generate a new group of colors that can be clicked at any time.  
	- Things I learned from this project:
		I now feel very comfortable with DOM manipulation and using event listeners.  This project also included great practice regarding how to create and include some subtle animations and/or transformations via javascript.  There was a big focus on functional decomposition, which I appreciated.
